The objective of this work is to develop a system of records (the so-called \emph{logs}) for the application of the University Restaurant of the University of the State of Amazonas. By the means of a REST API that makes use of Blockchain technology, all actions of a given user are persisted in a decentralized point-to-point network, ensuring that key aspects of Information Security are fulfilled and reinforced. Through the records made by the system, it becomes possible to carry out audits and generate reports of user activities.
